- Clarity
- Detailing
    - Bullet points
    - What you did -> What comes next
    - Action -> Outcome

- User issue
    - <name> states/reports/mentioned/described/etc.
- Steps to reproduce
    - Descriptive of what happens - action->results
    - CompTIA modifier
- Jargon-free: no acronyms. minus RAM.
    * If it's not industry standard (i.e. its internal only) then DONT USE IT
    * Assume any end-user will see this and need to be able to understand what you've done.
- Courtroom Context:
  * You should be able to comfortably defend or explain anything you write in a courtroom.
  * If you cannot, DO NOT WRITE IT.
