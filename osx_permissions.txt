Disk utility => REPAIRS ONLY WHAT IS ON THE DRIVE YOU'RE RUNNING FROM -> IF YOU BOOT OFF A RESOURCE DRIVE YOU ARENT FIXING IT!!!
RUN THE UTILITY FROM WHATEVER DRIVE YOU NEED FIXED AND DON'T RUN FROM DRIVE

-IT ONLY FIXES APPLICATIONS/LIBRARY/SYSTEM - NOT USER

-Works by checking receipts

RESET ACL'S WILL FIX YOUR USER FOLDERS PERMISSIONS -> USED WHEN PERMISSIONS ISSUES DO NOT OCCUR IN A KG USER

ACL = access control list

Posix permissions -> where we started with UNIX
