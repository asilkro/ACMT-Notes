* B - **Buddy** -> Tell another person in case you mess up and they need to get medical suport.
* O - **Off** -> Powered equipment is turned off and unplugged. Check twice, and enlist buddy if needed.
* B - **Bling** -> This is watches, jewelry, necklaces, and any other accessories.
* S - **Strap** -> ESD strap - if you're wearing one, take it off. Make sure you're not in the way of the electricity going to ground.
  
* M - **Mat** -> Disconnect the ESD mat from ground. Your discharge tool is how the electricity is going to ground, not the mat.
* E - **Eyes** -> Put on eye protection- high power + glass => eye danger.
* D - **Discharge** -> Once you're safe, don't waste time. Take the tool and get to it.
* S - **Safety** -> Reconnect the mat, re-strap up and return to your ESD safety and standards.
